    \title Adventures with QDoc's \\brief command
    \brief Test that the \\brief command doesn't eat content that follows it.
    \inmodule sometestgroup
    \keyword some_keyword

    The purpose of this test data is to provide a regression mechanism as part
    of QDoc's end-to-end test, tst_generatedOutput, for an issue (QTBUG-70959)
    that was reported against QDoc's \\keyword command. The issue, as
    experienced by the reporter of the bug, is that if the \\keyword command
    isn't followed by a new command, or is the last command in a paragraph,
    the following paragraph is "eaten". That means the entire paragraph is
    understood by QDoc as keywords and included as html meta information
    instead of as part of the rendered output.

    \section1 Further details
    The bug report is at \l https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-70959.
    It refers to a change that bypassed the issue by moving the \\keyword
    command, at \l https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtdoc/+/242033/.
